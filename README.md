In this project I have used I2C AT24256N EEPROM to read and write the data using serial monitor via USART.
The microcontroller I have used it STM32F401CCU6. I have used register level programming because it gives me more control over hardware. I have used both USB to TTL converter 
(CP2102) and MAX232 for sending or receiving data from controller to my PC.
